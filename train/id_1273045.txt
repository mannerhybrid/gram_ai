[State of the bone marrow hematopoiesis and peripheral blood in obesity].

Peripheral blood was studied before and after the treatment in 186 patients with various forms of adiposity; bone marrow was examined in 10 patients. The data obtained were compared with the STH level in the blood serum in the corresponding patients. The bone marrow of patients with adiposity displayed a reduction of myelokariocytes on account of mature neutrophils and normoblasts, a fall in reticulocyte and megakariocyte count and an increase in lymphocytes. Peripheral blood is characterized by reticulocytopenia, a reduction of leukocytes on account of granulocytes and an accelerated ESR. Possibly the detected shifts in myelogram and the peripheral blood were caused by the principal pathological process and the change of the somatotropic function of the adenohypophysis.
