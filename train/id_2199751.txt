Body fat distribution in females: metabolic consequences and implications for weight loss.

The main function of adipose tissue is to store triglyceride during relative affluence and to break down this fat and release fatty acids and glycerol when needed. Both the deposition and degradation of lipid are under precise hormonal and neural control. Recently, it has become evident that adipose tissue is not homogeneous and that the regional distribution of fat may be important with respect to metabolism and hormonal responsiveness and, thus, of interest from a number of viewpoints. This review will focus on the physiological significance of differences in adipose tissue distribution and implications for the female. Included will be the hormonal and metabolic consequences of child bearing and the metabolic outcome for chronic disease risk. Furthermore, the influence of the distribution of adiposity on weight loss by diet and exercise, as well as changes in fat and lean tissue, will be examined. Possible directions for future research in this area will be discussed.
