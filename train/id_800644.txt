[Effect of fasting on the function of the islands of Langerhans in rats with hypothalamic obesity].

Experiments were conducted on albino rats with hypothalamic adiposity caused by electrolyte damage of the area of the ventro-medial nuclei of the hypothalamus; it was shown that the character of food regimen had a significant effect on the function of the islar apparatus of the pancreas and glucose tolerance. There was a marked increase in functional activity of the beta-cells of the pancreatic islands and disturbed carbohydrate tolerance in the animals kept on food rich in carbohydrates. Prolonged starvation in rats with hypothalamic adiposity decreased the morphometric indices of overstrain in the insulinogenic tissue, and normalized the glycemic curves.
