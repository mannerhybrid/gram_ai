[On the relations between overweight and age (author's transl)].

There are reported new results on pathogenesis, etiology, and classification of adiposity under consideration of the age. The examinations show, that the postulated hyperphagia of the adipose person cannot be demonstrated so simply, therefore it is necessary to make longitudinal studies in further researches in this field. There are given simple directive rules for classification of the adipose persons to overcome the common uncertainly in this regard. New studies on the motivation of adipose persons for visiting a adiposity dispensary show an age dependence, in which in younger persons mostly esthetic causes, in the elderly sanitary causes are important.
