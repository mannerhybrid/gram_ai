Fat suction versus abdominoplasty.

The author describes his fat-suction technique for the treatment of abdominal adiposity. He stresses the importance of the proper selection of patients prior to surgery and the indications for such surgery, analyzing especially the accumulation of subcutaneous adiposity and muscular flaccidity. He divides surgical techniques into four separate groups: isolated fat suction; fat suction associated with infraumbilical cutaneous resection; fat suction associated with conventional abdominoplasty; and, conventional abdominoplasty. The criteria of indications for each separate procedure are strongly emphasized.
