Alterations in low-density lipoproteins in subjects with abdominal adiposity.

Abdominal adiposity, as indexed by the waist to hip girth ratio (WHR), has been associated with increased risk and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). The purpose of this study was to determine if this enhanced risk is related to alterations in the structure of low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL were isolated from nine nonobese men with an average WHR of 1.046 and nine nonobese men with a WHR of 0.94, who were matched on age (45.6 +/- 2.7 v 47.7 +/- 2.3 mean +/- SEM) percent body fat (26.5 +/- 0.5 v 26.1 +/- 0.9), and body mass index (27.3 +/- 0.6 v 26.3 +/- 0.6). The average molecular weight of LDL from the subjects with a high WHR was lower than that of subjects with low WHR (2.70 v 3.02 x 10(6) d), the average hydrated density higher (1.050 v 1.040 g/mL), and the mobility (Rf) on 2% to 16% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis higher. Subfractionation by equilibrium density ultracentrifugation showed that the LDL of subjects with a high WHR was predominantly in the heavy density range (1.038 to 1.048 g/mL) compared with the LDL of subjects with low WHR, which was in the lighter density range (1.030 to 1.040 g/mL). Chemical analysis of the subfractions showed that the peak density fractions of LDL of subjects with a high WHR had a lower cholesterol to protein ratio than the peak density fractions of LDL of subjects with low WHR. Electron microscopy of these peak density fractions showed that LDL of subjects with high WHR was smaller than that of subjects with low WHR. These characteristics of LDL of subjects with abdominal adiposity closely resemble the properties of LDL of patients with documented CHD. It is concluded that the increased risk of CHD associated with abdominal adiposity may be due in part to the alterations in LDL characteristics, and that these alterations in LDL are independent of the degree of obesity.
