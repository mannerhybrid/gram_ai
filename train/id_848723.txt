Adiposity and the pharmacokinetics of halothane. The effect of adiposity on the maintenance of and recovery from halothane anaesthesia.

Thirty fit patients (15-70 years, 46-98 kg) undergoing body-surface operations were selected to include a wide range of adiposity (12-45% of total body weight estimated from measurements of skinfold thickness). They were anaesthetized with halothane and 70% N2O in O2. From measurements of total ventilation (ml min-1 kg-1) and of halothane concentrations in inspired (F1) end-tidal (FE') and 'mixed-spill' (FS) gases, the following parameters were calculated for 5-min intervals from 20 to 40 min after induction; the rate of uptake of halothane per percent inspired concentration (Vha1 ml min-1%-1) and the degree of equilibrium achieved with the inspired concentration, calculated as FE'/F1 expressed as a percentage. Multiple-regression analysis of the results for 19 patients, taking account of the effects of body fat, ventilation, age, and the blood-gas partition coefficient lambda of halothane for the individual patient, showed that Vha1 increased with adiposity (b=0-375, P=0-0019), and with ventilation (b=0-054, P=0-09) but decreased with increasing age (b=-0-258, P=0-006). The time intervals between the end of the anaesthetic and the achievement of four defined levels of recovery (response to painful stimulus obedience to a simple command, response to a question, orientation in time and space), were recorded. Multiple-regression analysis showed that recovery time increased with addiposity, duration of administration and end-tidal concentration at the end of the administration, and decreased with increasing age. All four effects were statistically non-significant at the first levels of recovery but all increased at the later levels and all eventually became significant.
