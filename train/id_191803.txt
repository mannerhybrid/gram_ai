[Adrenocorticotropic function of the pituitary gland in endocrine diseases].

In examination of 123 patients with diabetes mellitus. Itsenko-Cushing disease, Addison's disease, thyrotoxicosis and adiposity there was revealed an increase in the content of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the blood. Comparison of the ACTH and cortizol concentration in the blood permitted to suppose a different mechanism of the derangements revealed. An increase of the adrenocorticotropic function of the hypophysis in diabetes mellitus, Itsenko-Cushing disease and thyrotoxicosis was accompanied by a rise in the blood cortizol level. A fall of glucocorticoid function of the adrenal glands in Addison's disease and a relative hypocorticism in the patients with adiposity caused a compensatory intensification of the ACTH secretion.
