Voluntary regulation of energy balance in farmed raccoon dogs.

1. Seasonal changes in body mass and voluntary feed intake were studied in juvenile raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides, Gray 1834) under farm conditions. 2. The body weight maximum was achieved in mid-November. Thereafter, body weight gradually declined towards summer. This pattern was closely connected to voluntary regulation of feed consumption. During autumn, appetite of the animals was good enhancing gradual deposition of excessive fat reserves. 3. Excessive adiposity itself, together with factors like shortening daylength and decreasing air temperature, seemed to play as a trigger for starting of winter rest. 4. The results support the endogenic nature of energy balance regulation.
