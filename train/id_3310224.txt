[Results of sonographic diagnosis of ureteral calculi].

In a retrospective study in 61 cases of sonographically, roentgenologically and clinically diagnosed calculi in the ureter, the sensitivity was found to be 64%. During the observation period of 2 years this increased from 69% to 84% with experienced investigators. Investigators with less than one year's experience achieved a level of 14%. Diagnosis of calculi in the ureter requires a special examination method using sector scanners. The results are additionally influenced by ureteral width, filling of the urinary bladder, meteorism and adiposity. If sonographic diagnosis is skillfully handled, it becomes possible to restrict the use of the I.V. pyelogram to a few instances and indications only.
