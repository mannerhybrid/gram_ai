Effect of embryonic and neonatal administration of tamoxifen on adiposity in the broiler chicken.

1. The effect of early exposure of heavy breed (HB) chicks to an anti-oestrogen (tamoxifen--TAM) on later adiposity was studied. 2. TAM administration at the embryonic stage, but not at the day of hatching, reduced adiposity in females but not in males, at 8 to 9 weeks of age. This reduction in adiposity in females minimised or even alleviated the excess of fat in females compared to males.
