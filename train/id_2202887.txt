Metabolic responses of forearm and adipose tissues to acute ethanol ingestion.

Although excess ethanol consumption is often considered to lead to adiposity, the metabolic routes by which this might occur are not clear. We have investigated some metabolic consequences of acute ethanol ingestion by measuring arteriovenous differences across forearm muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue for 6 hours after ingestion of 47.5 g ethanol, in seven normal subjects fasted overnight. The expected systemic effects of ethanol ingestion were observed: slight lowering of the plasma glucose concentration, depression of plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations, and elevation of the blood lactate/pyruvate and 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratios. There was a marked reduction in blood total ketone bodies in relation to plasma NEFA concentrations. However, the only major change observed in peripheral tissue metabolism was an increased uptake of acetate into forearm muscle, equivalent, in whole-body terms, to only 3% of the ethanol load. Adipose tissue appeared to show a reduced cytoplasmic state in that it exported an increased ratio of lactate to pyruvate after ethanol ingestion. However, this reduced state did not lead to increased fatty acid reesterification within adipose tissue. No mechanism was clearly identified whereby ethanol ingestion might lead to net deposition of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue.
