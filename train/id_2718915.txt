Impact of dietary fat content and fat oxidation on energy intake in humans.

Three studies were performed to assess the effects of a high-fat diet and exercise-induced changes in fat oxidation on energy intake in humans. In the first study the short-term effect of a high-fat diet on spontaneous energy intake was investigated. The second study evaluated the long-term effect of a high-fat diet on adiposity and the third study evaluated the effect of exercise-induced changes in fat oxidation on short-term regulation of energy intake when subjects were consuming a high-fat diet. The results of these studies indicate that a high-fat diet induces a short-term hyperphagia, a high percentage of lipids in the usual diet is associated with a higher adiposity, and exercise may attenuate or amplify the high-fat, diet-induced hyperphagia, depending on the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase in fat oxidation.
