Adipose tissue distribution and plasma lipoprotein levels in obese women. Importance of intra-abdominal fat.

Prospective studies have shown that excess abdominal fat is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and related death. We used computed axial tomography (CAT) to assess the association between deep and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and plasma lipoprotein levels in a sample of 52 premenopausal obese women aged 35.7 +/- 5.5 years (mean +/- SD). Whereas the plasma lipoprotein concentration were not significantly correlated with fat mass, the data obtained by CAT indicated that the absolute amount of deep abdominal fat was negatively correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CHOL) levels (r = -0.35, p less than 0.01), as well as with HDL-CHOL/low density lipoprotein (LDL)-CHOL, HDL-apoprotein-(apo) A-I/LDL-apo B, and HDL2-CHOL/HDL3-CHOL ratios (-0.32 less than or equal to r less than or equal to -0.40, 0.05 greater than p less than 0.01). Adipose tissue deposition at the mid-thigh region determined by CAT did not show any significant relationship with plasma lipoprotein levels. When subgroups of women with comparable ages and adiposity but with high and low intra-abdominal fat accumulation were compared, women with a high accumulation of intra-abdominal fat displayed significantly lower HDL-CHOL (p less than 0.001), HDL2-CHOL (p less than 0.001), HDL3-CHOL (p less than 0.01), and HDL-apo A-I (p less than 0.05) levels, as well as reduced HDL-CHOL/LDL-CHOL (p less than 0.01), HDL-apo A-I/LDL-apo B (p less than 0.05), and HDL2-CHOL/HDL3-CHOL ratios (p less than 0.05) in comparison with obese women with low accumulations of intra-abdominal fat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
