Residual abnormalities of insulin secretion and sensitivity after weight loss by obese women.

Changes in plasma insulin and glucose concentrations before and after feeding were measured in six female subjects (post-obese) who had regained a normal body mass after a history of severe obesity (mean weight loss, 37.1 +/- 2.6 kg). The responses of the post-obese group were compared with a group of weight- and age-matched subjects who had not been obese (lean). After an overnight fast subjects were fed a meal at 09.00 h and 13.10 h. Fasting and post-prandial insulin concentrations were lower in post-obese than in lean subjects. Immediately after beginning to eat at 13.10 h all subjects showed a rise in insulin concentration with no change in glucose concentration. In this pre-absorptive period there was no significant difference in insulin concentration between post-obese and lean subjects, although the increment in insulin concentration over baseline values was greater in post-obese subjects (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that abnormalities of insulin secretion and action remain after weight loss by obese subjects. These abnormalities may predispose to hyperphagia and accumulation of excess adiposity.
