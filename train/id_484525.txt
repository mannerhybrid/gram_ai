Serum alpha-tocopherol, lipids, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase in normal and malabsorption patients.

Serum alpha-tocopherol, lipids, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase levels were measured in 20 adult male control patients and eight malabsorption patients. The malabsorption group had significantly lower serum alpha-tocopherol levels than the control group. This change was independent of serum total lipid levels that were not significantly different among the two groups. Serum potassium and creatine phosphokinase levels that are normally used to assess muscle pathology in man did not correlate with serum alpha-tocopherol levels in either the control of the malabsorption groups. Body mass indices that are directly related to adiposity of the individuals were calculated. Among the control patients, there was a significant increase in serum alpha-tocopherol and serum total lipids with increase in body mass index. Similar correlations did not exist in the malabsorption group. In the latter group serum alpha-tocopherol levels may have reached low enough levels to be independent of factors such as adiposity and serum total lipids.
