[Thyrotropic function of the hypophysis in endocrine diseases].

The content of thyrotropic hormone of the hypophysis (by radioimmunological method) and the level of thyrotropic hormones in the blood plasma were studied in 178 patients with various endocrine pathology (thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Itsenko-Cushing disease, Addison's disease, adiposity). Healthy persons (33) served as control. Thyrotropic function of the hypophysis proved to be decreased in thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, adiposity, Itsenko-Cushing disease. Comparison of the plasma level of thyrotropin and thyroid hormones led to a supposition on a different mechanism of the detected changes. A marked intensification on the thyrotropic function of the hypophysis was observed in primary hypothyroidism. A tendency to increase of thyrotropin discharge was noted in the patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis given antithyroid treatment and in Addison's disease.
