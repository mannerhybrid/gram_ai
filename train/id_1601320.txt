[The distribution of adipose tissue is related to the levels of insulin in the obese woman].

We studied 51 patients aged 20-35 years, with overweight or obesity evaluated by the body mass index (BMI = weight height2) when it was higher than 25 (normal 20-25), and a control group of six women with the same age and normal BMI. In all patients waist and hip circumferences were measured, to calculate the waist/hip ratio (WHR). Also serum insulin was measured in basal conditions and as response to 75 g oral glucose load, taking samples at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after. The test were performed 3 to 6 days following a spontaneous or induced genital bleeding with progestin. The WHR showed a normal distribution with the greatest frequency at 0.87. The patients were classified with predominance of adiposity in the upper body segment, when the WHR was equal or more than 0.85, and with adipose predominance in the lower body segment when it was equal or less than 0.84. The average insulin values in response to oral glucose load of patients with upper body segment obesity were significantly higher (Mann-Whitney's U = 0, p less than 0.02) than the corresponding cases with lower body segment obesity. Besides, there was a significant correlation between WHR and serum insulin values at 30 minutes after the oral glucose load (Pearson's r = 0.331, p less than 0.02). These results suggest a relation between the distribution of adiposity and insulin values, which were higher in patients with adipose predominance in the upper body segment.
