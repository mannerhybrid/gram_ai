The prediction in boys and girls of the weight/height index and various skinfold measurements in adults: a two-decade follow-up study.

Prediction of adiposity in adults from anthropometric measurements (arm and trunk skinfolds, weight/height) made during childhood and adolescence was assessed in a two-decade follow-up study. Weight/height showed the best correlation between childhood and adulthood values in both sexes. The child-adult correlations for skinfolds were better in males than in females and their value varied according to body site. In males, trunk skinfolds showed slightly better correlations than arm sites, and the weakest correlations were observed for the biceps. In females arm skinfolds, especially the biceps, showed a better predictive value than trunk skinfolds for which the child-adult correlation was almost nil. Trunk skinfolds, which are more often associated with metabolic complications of obesity than limb skinfolds, are predictable from childhood measurements in males and not in females. The prediction of adiposity development in different body sites may help identify children most susceptible to various pathologies in later life.
