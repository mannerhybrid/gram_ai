[Methodologic evaluation of the relation of blood pressure and skinfold thickness: an epidemiologic approach].

The empirical evidence concerning the relationship between blood pressure and anthropometric characteristics (triceps skinfold, adiposity, and arm circumference) was assessed by means of meta-analysis. Different studies were evaluated critically for strength of design, methods and associations. It was found that the association between blood pressure and triceps skinfold holds for three different demographic categories. The question as to the independence of these associations remained unsolved. The effect of arm adiposity on the measurement of blood pressure was also discussed. Recommendations are give in order to standardize blood pressure measurements in clinical and research settings.
