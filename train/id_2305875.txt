Effects of age and level of physical activity on plasma norepinephrine kinetics.

We examined the effects of age and physical activity on plasma norepinephrine (NE) kinetics in active and inactive older and younger men. NE kinetics were estimated by calculation of the rates of NE appearance and clearance during infusion of tritiated norepinephrine [( 3H]-NE). Older active men had the highest level of plasma NE (pg/ml) and NE appearance (microgram.min-1.FFW-1, where FFW is fat-free weight) relative to younger men and inactive older men. NE clearance (l.min-1.FFW-1) was not influenced by age or physical activity. No significant associations were noted between percent body fat, supine blood pressure with resting levels of NE, NE appearance, and NE clearance. We concluded that 1) chronic participation in physical activity by older men, but not younger men, is associated with higher resting levels of plasma NE and NE appearance and 2) the degree of adiposity does not influence plasma NE kinetics in healthy younger and older men. The level of physical activity is an influencing factor on plasma NE and NE appearance into circulation in healthy older men.
