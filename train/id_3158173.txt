Abdominoplasty combined with correction of the flaccidity of the lateral lower abdomen and the flanks.

The author describes a surgical technique for correction of adiposity and flaccidity of both the abdominal wall and the flank region. The technique produces a better final outcome with regard to the resultant lateral "dog-ears" and flaccidity of the flanks that may result after routine abdominoplasty operation.
