[Adipose tissue sensitivity to insulin in obese ovariectomized rats].

A study was made of sensitivity of the isolated adipose tissue in rats with ovariectomy and overfeeding. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the intensity of glucose-C14 incorporation into total lipids of adipose tissue in its incubation with insulin in a concentration of 100 minutes/ml. It was demonstrated that 3 1/2 months after the operation no adiposity developed in ovariectomized rats and insulin sensitivity of the adipose tissue persisted at the normal level. In the excessively fed animals, which due to individual peculiarities of food consumption retained their normal weight, insulin sensitivity of the adipose tissue also remained unchanged. At the same time, with increase in weight caused by overfeeding or ovariectomy in combination with overfeeding, there was no intensification of glucose metabolism under the effect of insulin. The mentioned reduction of insulin sensitivity apparently served as one of the causes leading to development of a relative insulin insufficiency in adiposity and the subsequent development of disturbances of carbohydrate and fat metabolism.
