[Age-related characteristics of hemodynamic adaptation to adipose tissue changes in men without arterial hypertension].

A combined clinical-instrumental study of hemodynamics and anthropometry of fatty and fatless body masses (FBM, FLBM) based on caliperometry of 8 skin fatty folds, were performed in 138 men aged 20 to 59 without arterial hypertension. An increase in age and excessive adipose deposits with the growth of relative FBM were accompanied by adaptive changes of the central and regional hemodynamics characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance, and a decrease in the volumetric crural blood flow. The influence of adiposity on hemodynamics, mostly expressed in a young age, particularly at the age of 30-39, made more rapid the appearance in young men with excessive adipose deposits of hemodynamic shifts typical of older age persons.
