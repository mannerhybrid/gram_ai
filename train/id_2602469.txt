Progesterone can either increase or decrease weight gain and adiposity in ovariectomized Syrian hamsters.

We examined the effects of estradiol and progesterone on weight gain, food intake, and carcass composition in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). In ovariectomized (OVX) hamsters injections of 5 micrograms/day estradiol benzoate (EB) alone decreased weight gain and adiposity, whereas treatment with progesterone alone (1 or 5 mg/day) resulted in increased weight gain and adiposity. However, concurrent treatment with progesterone and EB reduced body fat content to levels significantly below those of hamsters treated with EB alone. In a second experiment, 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone were administered via subcutaneous Silastic capsules in doses which produce physiological levels of steroids. Implants of estradiol significantly decreased body weight gain and fat content. As in the first experiment, these effects of estradiol were exaggerated by concurrent progesterone administration. Implants of progesterone alone did not affect body weight or fatness in OVX hamsters. These data indicate that estradiol and progesterone interact to decrease body lipid stores in hamsters, whereas in rats progesterone reverses the adiposity-reducing actions of estradiol. This species difference in responses to progesterone could help to explain why rats increase, whereas hamsters decrease, their body lipid stores during pregnancy, when circulating progesterone levels are elevated.
