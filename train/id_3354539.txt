Leisure time physical activity and blood pressure in schoolchildren.

The relation between blood pressure and habitual physical activity during leisure time was investigated in a random sample of 272 sixth grade schoolchildren (mean age, 11.3 years) who entered secondary school in 1983 in Marano di Napoli, a suburb of Naples, Italy. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and anthropometry were measured with standardized techniques. Physical activity was evaluated by a questionnaire outlining four levels of physical activity during leisure time. The study provided evidence that a low level of physical activity during leisure time in 11-year-old children is associated with higher systolic blood pressure independent of sex, age, and adiposity. These findings may be relevant to programs of primary prevention of arterial hypertension in early life.
