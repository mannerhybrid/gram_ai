Apolipoprotein A-I and A-II levels in an Australian population.

Values for apolipoproteins A-I and A-II (apo A-I and apo A-II) are reported for 389 women and 390 men in the town of Busselton, Western Australia. Apo A-I levels were found to be relatively constant with age in men but to rise with age in women. Apo A-II levels remained constant with age in men until older age, when they declined, but rose with age in women, showing a fall in the oldest age group. Apo A-I levels were greater in women than in men, but apo A-II levels were lower in younger women than in younger men, and higher in older women than in older men. On stepwise multiple regression analysis, neither apo A-I nor apo A-II levels showed an independent relationship with age in women; the same was true for apo A-I in men. Alcohol consumption was directly associated with apo A-I and A-II levels in both sexes; adiposity was inversely associated with apo A-I levels in both sexes but with apo A-II only in women. Triglyceride levels showed an inverse association with apo A-II in women. Frequency of exercise was independently and directly associated with apo A-I and A-II levels in women only.
