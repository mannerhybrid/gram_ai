Physical training and changes in regional adipose tissue distribution.

Obesity has been associated with numerous metabolic complications, such as changes in the concentration and/or composition of plasma lipoproteins, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia leading to diabetes and hypertension. The relation of obesity to cardiovascular disease has not, however, been consistently reported. Recent prospective studies have clearly indicated that the distribution of adipose tissue was a significant cardiovascular risk factor and numerous studies have shown that metabolic disturbances were more closely associated with the level of abdominal fat than excess adiposity per se. As obese men generally store their energy excess in the abdominal region and women in the peripheral fat depots, the metabolic complications of obesity seem to be more closely related to adiposity in men than in women. It is suggested that the sex dimorphism observed in adipose tissue localization could partly explain the greater cardiovascular risk associated with obesity in men than in women. Indeed, obese women with a "male" (abdominal) distribution of body fat have greater metabolic complications than women with lower body fat. When aerobic exercise-training is used to induce weight loss, men generally lose more fat than women. In men, the loss of adipose tissue appears to be central, potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas a relative resistance to fat loss is observed in women compared to men. Although resistance to fat loss is noted in women, those with a "male" distribution of adipose tissue (high waist-to-hip ratio and high intra-abdominal fat deposition) and with associated metabolic complications greatly benefit from aerobic exercise-training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
