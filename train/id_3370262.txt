Metabolic development of porcine fetal adipose tissue. A role for central regulation.

The influence of neural and endocrine status upon the metabolic activity and insulin responses of developing adipose tissue of fetal swine was examined. Central neural and endocrine regulation were removed by decapitation of fetuses at 45 days of gestation. Decapitated (decap) fetuses and intact littermates were removed at 65, 85 or 110 days of gestation. Fatty acid synthesis from glucose increased fivefold in slices of subcutaneous adipose tissue from intact fetuses and tenfold in tissue from decaps, between days 65 and 110 gestation. Insulin had minimal effects in intact tissue but stimulated glucose metabolism as early as 65 days of gestation in decap adipose tissue. Lactate was utilized for oxidation and fatty acid synthesis at rates as high or higher than glucose throughout gestation. These results indicate possible roles for lactate and insulin in producing the increased adiposity of decapitated fetal pigs reported previously. Secondly, the more active metabolism of decap tissue indicates that fatty acid synthesis in normal fetal adipose tissue is suppressed by development of inhibitory factors regulated by central mechanisms during late gestation.
