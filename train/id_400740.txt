Effect of age on fasting plasma levels of pancreatic hormones in man.

The effect of age and adiposity on fasting plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide (HPP), glucagon (IRG), insulin (IRI) and glucose was examined in 263 healthy subjects between the ages of 20-69 yr. Mean plasma levels of hPP rose continuously from the third through the seventh decades. Mean plasma levels of IRG rose within the third and fourth decades but failed to rise further thereafter. Mean plasma levels of IRI did not change with age. Mean plasma levels of glucose rose by approximately 2 mg/dl . decade. The correlations of age with hPP, IRG, glucose, and adiposity were 0.47, 0.35, 0.25 (all P less than 0.01) and 0.15 (P less than 0.05), respectively. When adjustments were made for adiposity, the correlations of age with hPP, IRG, and glucose remained. Adiposity correlated with IRI, IRG, and glucose but when age correction was made, only the correlation of adiposity with IRI persisted. We conclude that: 1) age has a significant effect on fasting plasma levels of hPP and IRG; 2) the patterns of the age-related changes in hPP and IRG are not the same, suggesting that there are differences in the mechanism(s) by which age influences plasma levels of these two pancreatic hormones; and 3) age should be considered in the interpretation of fasting plasma levels of hPP and IRG.
