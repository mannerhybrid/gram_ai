[Correlation of the changes in the calorimetric indices of energy metabolism and of the morphofunctional changes in the thyroid gland of rats with various forms of experimental obesity].

Changes in heat exchange were compared with the morphofunctional changes of the thyroid gland in rats with various forms of experimental adiposity. Reduction of the hormone-forming function of the thyroid gland proved to correlate with the changes in heat formation and thermoregulation, and corresponded to the degree of adiposity observed.
